  <h1>  Engineering in Code</h1>
<p>One thing I weirdly miss about being in one of the physical engineering worlds is the amount of structure around everything. No matter what you tried to do, there was always standard knowledge that had been established, researched, and tested.

<div id="welcome">
<p>Software doesn't have any type of enforcement like <span> mechanical engineering </span>, because most of the stuff we make won't kill anyone if it breaks. So I started taking some of the design principles I had never gotten a chance to apply to cars, and applying them to my personal software projects.
