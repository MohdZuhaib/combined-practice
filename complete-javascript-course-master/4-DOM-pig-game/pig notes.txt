Watch Dom access and manipulation again!!!

we have to select a button to add an event like roll a dice :
document.query selector(.classOfdice) //this will select dice

for rolling:
document.querryselector(.btnrollClass) //we have our selection now


To add an event listener:

document.querryselector(.btnrollClass).addEventListener(eventType(example click),funcn to be called during event)
